# VOICE RECOGNITION BASED DATA ENTRY SCRIPT

### I developed this script as a project for a local business that required large amounts of data entry and would hire special people for it. This script solved their problems and reduced the cost of labour.

### This project aims to solve the following problems:
- Fatigue of long hours of data entry
- Incorrect spellings and grammar
- Non-Uniform Data alignment
- Dedicated person for the job



## Quick start
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/grajat90/speech-data-entry.git`.
- [Download from Github](https://github.com/grajat90/speech-data-entry/archive/master.zip).


## Documentation

- Place the original pdf in the default folder with the name `original.pdf`
- Run `main.py` 
					`python main.py`
- Wait for on screen instructions and speak directlt into the main microphone.
- Say `finish` when you're done with the data entry
- The output will be ontained as a new pdf file name `destination.pdf`

## This may not work for your particular case as the alignments are hard coded. This was specifically intended for use for this special case only. However, modifications may be made to fit your needs.
